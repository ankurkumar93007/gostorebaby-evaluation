GoStoreBaby – Frontend Intern Evaluation Task

What I Learned:
This task helped me understand how HTML, CSS and JavaScript come together to make a simple but working webpage. I learned how to link external files properly and also how to use soft color themes to match the product style. I also picked up a small trick of using media queries so the page looks fine on mobile screens too.

What Was Easy:
Making the basic HTML structure was not too hard. Styling with colors and fonts was also fun and easy for me because I like experimenting with design.

What Was Difficult:
At first I found it a bit confusing to make the layout responsive and make sure it doesn’t break on small screens. JavaScript form validation also took me a few tries because of the regex. Another part was dividing the code into clean separate files (HTML, CSS, JS) without breaking anything.

How I Solved Problems:
I looked up some examples on w3schools and checked the code step by step in the browser console to fix errors. I tested my page on phone and desktop to see how it looks. For regex, I searched a simple pattern for email validation and adjusted it. Splitting the code into files became easier once I linked them carefully.

Overall:
It was a good practice task. I now feel more confident in writing a neat landing page from scratch.
